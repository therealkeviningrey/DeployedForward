# AI Workflow Setup

Welcome to your first mission. You'll configure a production-ready AI development environment and execute your first assisted workflow.

## Objective

By the end of this mission, you'll have a fully operational AI-enhanced development setup that you can deploy immediately.

## Prerequisites

- macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- Basic terminal proficiency
- Git installed

## Step 1: Install Core Tools

Install the Deployed Forward CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.deployedforward.com | sh
```

Verify installation:

```bash
df --version
```

## Step 2: Configure Your Environment

Initialize your workspace:

```bash
df init my-project
cd my-project
```

This creates a structured project with AI workflow templates pre-configured.

## Step 3: Your First AI Workflow

Run the scaffold workflow:

```bash
df workflow run scaffold --template api
```

This generates a production-ready API structure using AI-assisted code generation.

## Step 4: Review & Deploy

Inspect the generated code:

```bash
df review
```

Deploy to your environment:

```bash
df deploy --target staging
```

## What You've Accomplished

- ✅ Installed and configured the DF CLI
- ✅ Created a structured AI-ready project
- ✅ Executed an AI-assisted workflow
- ✅ Deployed working code
