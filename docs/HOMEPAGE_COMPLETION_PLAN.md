## 🎬 **Video Recommendations**

If you provide video, here's what works best:

### **Option A: Course Walkthrough (60-90 seconds)**
```
0-15s:  Show course dashboard
15-30s: Click into a lesson
30-50s: Student follows along, builds something
50-70s: Deploy the project
70-90s: Show it working live
```

**Narration**: "This is Sarah. She's never coded before. Watch her build and deploy a working chatbot in one lesson."

### **Option B: Student Journey (45-60 seconds)**
```
0-15s:  Before - frustrated, stuck
15-30s: Enrolled, started first lesson
30-45s: Built first project
45-60s: After - confident, shipping
```

**Narration**: "From idea to deployed product in 2 weeks. No coding background required."

### **Option C: Split Screen Demo (30-45 seconds)**
```
Left: Traditional tutorial (boring)
Right: Deployed Forward (exciting)

Show contrast:
- Passive watching vs active building
- Theory vs real projects
- Slow progress vs fast shipping
```

## 🖼️ **Image Recommendations**

If you provide images instead:

### **Must-Have (Top 3):**
1. **Student project screenshots** (6-8 examples)

   - Web apps
   - Chatbots
   - Dashboards

## 🎨 **Factory.ai Does This Well**

From their homepage:
- **Large product demo** (video or interactive)
- **Customer logo carousel** (we have this!)
- **Use case showcases** (Terminal/IDE/Web/Slack)
- **Social proof** (testimonials with photos)
- **Clear CTA hierarchy**

What they DON'T have that we could add:
- Student work gallery
- Before/after transformations
- Completion stats
- Interactive demos

---

## ✅ **My Recommendation**

**Do these 3 things to complete homepage:**

### **1. Student Projects Gallery** 🔥
**You provide**: 6-8 screenshots of projects (or I can use AI-generated mockups)  
**I build**: Beautiful gallery with hover effects, project names, build times  
**Impact**: HUGE - proves your value prop  

### **2. Enhanced Stats Section** 🔥
**You provide**: Real or aspirational numbers:
- X students enrolled
- Y projects shipped
- Z% completion rate
- Average rating

**I build**: Animated counter with live feel  
**Impact**: Medium - adds credibility  

### **3. Course Preview Video Section** 🔥🔥
**You provide**: 60-90 second video OR I build animated mockup  
**I build**: Video player with thumbnail, play button, captions  
**Impact**: HUGE - shows the experience  

---

## 🚀 **Start Here**

**Tell me:**
1. Can you provide 6-8 project screenshots? (landing pages, apps, etc.)
2. Can you record a 60-second screen recording of a lesson?
3. What numbers should I use for stats? (students, projects, completion rate)

**OR I can:**
- Generate mockup project screenshots
- Create an animated product tour (no video needed)
- Use placeholder stats that you can update later

**What assets can you provide, and I'll build the rest today?** 🎯
