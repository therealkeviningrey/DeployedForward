# Tactical Homepage - Assets Needed (Pre-Launch)
**Brand**: Forward Deployed (military/tactical aesthetic)  
**Status**: Pre-launch, no students yet  
**Approach**: Honest about being new, tactical about methodology

---

## 🎯 **What We've Achieved**

✅ **Kept tactical brand:**
- "Operator Training" not "Student Learning"
- "Deploy capability" not "Learn skills"
- "Missions" not "Lessons"
- "Execute" not "Practice"
- MOTHER terminal interface
- Military training photo

✅ **Removed fake social proof:**
- Deleted fake student testimonials
- Replaced with "Training Missions" (honest course content)
- Changed "Trusted by" → "Master these tools"
- Stats show course content, not fake students

---

   Every Mission Follows:
   BRIEF → EXECUTE → DEPLOY → VERIFY
   ```

3. **Tech Stack Grid**
   ```
   Tools You'll Master:
