# Pre-Launch Homepage Strategy
**Status**: Pre-launch, no students yet  
**Goal**: Build credibility and waitlist WITHOUT fake social proof

---

## ✅ **What to Keep (Honest)**

✅ MOTHER terminal (shows potential student journey)  
✅ Tactical training image (shows teaching approach)  
✅ "What you'll master" (promises, not fake proof)  
✅ Logo marquee (companies you USE/integrate with)  

---

## ❌ **What to Remove/Replace (Dishonest)**

❌ Student testimonials (Sarah Chen, Marcus Rodriguez) - **DELETE THESE**  
❌ "Student outcomes" stats (no students yet) - **REFRAME**  
❌ "Student success stories" section - **REPLACE**  
❌ "Trusted by operators at" - **CHANGE MESSAGING**
