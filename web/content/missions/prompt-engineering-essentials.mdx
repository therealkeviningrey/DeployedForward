# Prompt Engineering Essentials

Learn the operational patterns that separate effective AI workflows from random experimentation.

## The Anatomy of a Working Prompt

Every production-ready prompt has three components:

1. **Context** — what the AI needs to know
2. **Task** — what you want done
3. **Constraints** — boundaries and format

### Example: Code Generation

**Bad prompt:**
```
Write a function
```

**Good prompt:**
```
You are a senior TypeScript engineer.

Write a pure function that validates email addresses.
Requirements:
- Input: string
- Output: boolean
- No external dependencies
- Include JSDoc comments
- Add 3 test cases
```

## Context Engineering

The quality of your output is directly proportional to the context you provide.

### Workspace Context

```bash
df context load --scope workspace
```

This injects:
- Project structure
- Coding standards
- Existing patterns
- Dependencies

### Task-Specific Context

```bash
df context add --file src/auth/types.ts --purpose "match these patterns"
```

## Building Templates

Create reusable prompt templates:

```bash
df template create api-endpoint
```

Example template:

```yaml
name: api-endpoint
context:
  - project-standards
  - existing-routes
prompt: |
  Create a new API endpoint:
  - Method: {{method}}
  - Path: {{path}}
  - Purpose: {{description}}
  
  Follow existing patterns in routes/.
  Include validation, error handling, and tests.
```

## Real-World Application

Generate a complete CRUD endpoint:

```bash
df generate endpoint \
  --method POST \
  --path /api/users \
  --description "Create new user with validation"
```

## Checkpoint

You should now be able to:

- ✅ Structure effective prompts
- ✅ Engineer relevant context
- ✅ Build reusable templates
- ✅ Generate production code consistently
