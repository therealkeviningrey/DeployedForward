# Setting Up Your Environment

Before you run your first AI workflow, you need three things installed: the CLI, an API key, and your IDE integration.

## Step 1: Install the CLI

The `df` CLI is your primary interface for running missions and workflows.

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.deployedforward.com | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://get.deployedforward.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

Verify it works:
```bash
df --version
```

You should see version 1.0.0 or higher.

## Step 2: Authenticate

Connect your Deployed Forward account:

```bash
df auth login
```

This opens your browser for authentication. Once complete, your CLI is linked to your account.

## Step 3: Configure Your API Key

Most workflows need an AI provider. We support OpenAI, Anthropic, and Azure OpenAI.

```bash
df config set ai.provider openai
df config set ai.key YOUR_API_KEY
```

Alternatively, set environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

## Step 4: IDE Integration (Optional)

Install the VS Code extension:

1. Open VS Code
2. Search extensions for "Deployed Forward"
3. Install and reload

Or install via CLI:

```bash
code --install-extension deployed-forward.vscode-df
```

For Cursor or JetBrains, see the [IDE integration docs](https://docs.deployedforward.com/ide).

## Checkpoint

Run the diagnostic:

```bash
df doctor
```

You should see:
- ✅ CLI installed
- ✅ Authenticated
- ✅ AI provider configured
- ✅ IDE integration detected (optional)
