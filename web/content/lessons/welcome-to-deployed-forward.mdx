# Welcome to Deployed Forward

You're about to start training in operational AI workflows. This isn't theory — everything you'll learn deploys to production.

## What Makes This Different

**Most AI training:**
- Teaches concepts without context
- Uses toy examples
- Leaves you to figure out implementation

**Deployed Forward training:**
- Field-tested workflows
- Production-ready patterns
- Deployable output from day one

## How Missions Work

Each mission follows this structure:

1. **Objective** — what you'll accomplish
2. **Prerequisites** — what you need installed
3. **Steps** — hands-on implementation
4. **Checkpoint** — verify you can deploy it
5. **Next Mission** — build on what you learned

## Your Path Forward

We've organized training into three levels:

**Operator** — Individual capability. You can deploy AI workflows independently.

**Unit** — Team workflows. You can coordinate AI usage across 5-10 people.

**Battalion** — Organization-wide. You can govern and scale AI across multiple teams.

## Start Simple

Your first mission is **AI Workflow Setup**. It takes 15 minutes. You'll install tools and deploy your first AI-assisted workflow.

No theory. Just working code.

Let's begin.
