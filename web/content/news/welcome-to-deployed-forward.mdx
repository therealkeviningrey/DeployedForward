# Welcome to Deployed Forward

The gap between "using AI" and deploying capability keeps widening. Most teams experiment. Few operationalize.

## The Problem

- **Random AI usage** → inconsistent output
- **No shared patterns** → every developer reinvents the wheel
- **Training without context** → concepts that don't transfer to your stack

## The Solution

Deployed Forward is an operational intelligence platform. You train on field-tested workflows, not theory.

### What You Get

**Briefs** — 10-minute intelligence updates. What's working in production, not hype.

**Missions** — Hands-on training with measurable outcomes. You deploy working code, not toy examples.

**Campaigns** — Bundled capabilities. Deploy an entire workflow as a unit.

## Who This Is For

You're building software in a world where AI is table stakes. You need:

- Repeatable workflows, not one-off experiments
- Patterns that scale across your team
- Training that produces deployable results

## What's Next

1. **[Start with Briefs](/programs/briefs)** — Get oriented on current operational patterns
2. **[Run your first Mission](/programs/missions)** — Deploy a working AI workflow
3. **[Join the community](#)** — Connect with operators solving similar problems

Train where the future is operational.
